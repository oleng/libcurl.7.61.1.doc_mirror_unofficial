<ul>
 <li> there's a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/238425">tech note
 from Microsoft</a> that says not to use WinInet from system context.
 <li> Even if you ignore the tech note, there are a bunch of annoyances with
 using WinInet from system context.  The biggest of which is proxy settings.
 In general, the settings are stored per user, so if you find yourself in
 system context, the correct settings may not be there.  Or, if you need to
 impersonate another user, you're in the same boat.  Gotta love the plain text
 config file.  I am curious if people worry about their proxy credentials
 lying around in plain text, or if they encrypt them, or what.
 <li> Even with the correct settings, there are certain versions of IE (I
 think it's 6, and maybe with some service packs) that don't work properly
 when communicating to proxies with basic authentication.
 <li> There are so many sweet features with curl that aren't available with
 WinInet. Like for example support for more protocols.
 <li> I've never tried to deal with Microsoft for WinInet support, but the
 curl support (i.e. the <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/mail/">libcurl mailing list</a>, and Daniel
 in particular) is <i>really</i> good.
 <li> Even if portability isn't a concern now, it might be later.  And,
 there's more than just code portability.  If you get good with curl, you'll
 have a useful skill if you work on other platforms.  I doubt we'll see
 WinInet ported anywhere else anytime soon.
 <li> We had some servers in-house and others outside our main network.  Each
 one needed its own proxy and id/password settings for connecting.  WinInet
 will only store one current configuration.  This meant that we couldn't
 connect to both an internal and external server at the same time.
 <li> Another issue was trying to explain to people that when they messed up
 their IE settings, the application would fail.
 <li> Some of our customers did not USE Internet Explorer.  It was installed,
 but not configured.  This meant they had to set up and configure the beast
 that is IE, even if they would never use it.
</ul>
<p> A quote from <a href="https://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/2003/Oct/0391.html">Leonard Rosenthol</a> on the abiword development mailing list:
<div class="quote">
<i> WinInet is fine for a "hack", but isn't usable for serious I/O - libcurl is
MUCH more robust, flexible, and faster.</i>

<p> Thanks to David Byron and Bradford Bruce for much of this input.
