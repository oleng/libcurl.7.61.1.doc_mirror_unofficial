<a name="reliable"></a>
<h2> Solid and Reliable! </h2>
<p>
 libcurl was released in its current "incarnation" in the year 2000 and it has
 been in constant use by a large number of applications
 and <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/companies.html">companies</a> ever since. Sure there have
 been bugs and even a few <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html">security-related</a>
 flaws, but it has remained a very solid and reliable library and lots of
 users are still using libcurl versions released many years ago as they stick
 with what works.
<a name="widelyused"></a>
<h2> Widely Used! </h2>
<p>
 libcurl is the most used C-based highly portable transfer library in the
 world. Some of the world's
 biggest <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/companies.html">companies</a> use libcurl in high
 volume applications. Some of the open source applications using libcurl are
 very widely used.
<p>
 We estimate that the amount of users who frequently use (lib)curl, knowingly
 or not, is well over one million.
<a name="portable"></a>
<h2> Portable! </h2>
<p>
 libcurl has been ported to numerous platforms and CPUs. libcurl offers the
 same API and feature set on all of them! Using libcurl assures you that you
 can write your application to work on very large amount of systems, including
 but not limited to Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, HPUX, IRIX,
 AIX, Tru64, Linux, UnixWare, HURD, Windows, Amiga, OS/2, BeOs, Mac OS X,
 Ultrix, QNX, OpenVMS, RISC OS, Novell NetWare, DOS and more...
<a name="thread"></a>
<h2> Thread Safe! </h2>
<p>
 libcurl is thread safe but there are a few exceptions. Refer to <a
 href="c/libcurl-thread.html">libcurl-thread(3)</a>
 for more information.
<a name="features"></a>
<h2> Unmatched Set of Features! </h2>
<p>
 There simply is no other HTTP and FTP library that can boast the same amount
 and set of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/features.html">features</a> that libcurl does. Be
 it free or commercial.
<p>
 Also, libcurl's unique offer of both a pull and push interface allows
 applications to use it exactly the way they please.
<p>
 libcurl also offers an unmatched set of bindings, enabling you to access and
 use libcurl from basically whatever language you can think of!
<a name="ipv6"></a>
<h2> Supports IPv6! </h2>
<p>
 If compiled with IPv6 support enabled, <b>All protocols</b> work splendidly
 on IPv6 stacks. There are some minor quirks to keep in mind: kerberos4 does
 not work over IPv6 by design and the SOCKS4 support is not properly adapted
 for IPv6.
<p> There is nothing in particular needed to get IPv6 to be used, the library
 API remains exactly the same and adjusts to IPv4/Ipv6 dynamicly. You can use
 host names that only have AAAA DNS records, or you can use IPv6 IP-only style
 addresses like <tt>[::1]</tt>.
<a name="support"></a>
<h2> Well Supported! </h2>
<p>
 We claim libcurl is well supported because you can get help on one of the
 mailing lists, very quickly and accurately. Often within a few hours. Having
 the mailing list archives available on the web also makes them searchable and
 allows you to find already mentioned solutions and answers.
<p>
 We have a public bug tracker and known bugs are mostly fixed very swiftly.
<p>
 We also provide very detailed documentation on all operations, not just in
 every release archive but also available on the web site(s).
<p>
 You can get paid support from one of the listed <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/support.html">curl
 support</a> companies.
<p>
 Since the code is free and available, any skilled programmer can fix and
 improve the tool and library whenever. If you can't, you can hire one!
<a name="fast"></a>
<h2> Fast! </h2>
<p>
 Tests performed by independent users, have proved libcurl to be equally fast,
 up to a lot faster than <a href="libwww.html">libwww</a> in comparable test
 cases.
<p>
 When using libcurl bindings, you will get unmatched speeds due to libcurl
 being programmed in C and very often the language-specific alternatives (be
 it perl, Python, PHP, tcl or whatever) are <i>much</i> slower.
<p>
 TODO: add references to hard facts here. <i>If you have any or know any
 comparisons with real-world numbers, then please let <a
 href="mailto:curl-web@haxx.se">us</a> know!</i>
<a name="docs"></a>
<h2> Thoroughly Documented! </h2>
<p> All functions in libcurl have their own detailed <a
 href="c/allfuncs.html">man pages</a> describing their actual
 functionality and purpose.
<p> All interfaces have overview-style man pages describing the concepts that
 glue all the functions together: <a
 href="c/libcurl-easy.html">easy</a>, <a
 href="c/libcurl-multi.html">multi</a> and <a
 href="c/libcurl-share.html">share</a>.
<p> There is a <a href="c/libcurl-tutorial.html">libcurl tutorial</a>.
<p> We have numerous commented <a href="c/example.html">source code
examples</a>.
<a name="stableapi"></a>
<h2> Stable API and ABI </h2>
<p>
 In the libcurl development we take API and ABI stability <b>very
 seriously</b>. We have a few rules when it comes to API and ABI compatibility
 and they are:<ol>
<li> We don't break API or ABI compatibility
<li> Seriously, we really don't and we work very hard to provide alternatives
that introduce new ways instead of breaking old
<li> A few times in the beginning of our project we felt forced to break
existing behavior and we did API and ABI bumps. It was painful and hard and
bad and we <b>really really</b> don't want to do it again. Ever! We have not
done it since 2006.
